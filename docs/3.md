# Evaluating Expressions
Take simplist path execute the syntax tree itself
Evaluate the expression and produce a value

# Respresenting values
-  We need to be able to check the type of a value at runtime
- Tell the object is truthy or not
- Tell if two object are eqaul
- Askin the object type is the only base operation we need
- We'll map each Lox type to it's  type

# Evaluating literals
A literal is a bit of syntax that produces a value
A literal comes from parser's domain.
Values are an interpreter concept, part of the runtime's world.
During the scanning stuffed it in the token. Parser took the value ans stuck it in the literal tree node, now to evaluate a literal, we simply pull it back out.

# Runtime errors
They are failures that the language semantics demand we detect and report
while the program is running.
While Runtime error needs to stop evaluating the expression, it should not kill the interpreter
