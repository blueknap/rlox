# Lexical scope / Static scope
This means that you can figure out which decleration a variable name refers to
just by reading the source code

A variable usage(expression or assignment) refers to the **preceding** decleration
with the same name in the **innermost** scope the encloses the expression where the variable used

> Since there is no mention of runtime behavior, it implies that a variable expression
> always refers to the same decleration through the entire execution of the program
> Static scope also means that a variable usage always resolves to the same decleration,
> which can be determined just by looking at the text

We create a new environment when we enter a new scope, discar it when we leave it

A closure retains a reference to the Environment instance in play when the function is
declared. Since any other delarations in that block would produce a new environment objects,
the closure would not see the new variables
