# Statements and State
Having a way to bind a name to some data or function. State and statements go hand in hand. Since statements, by definition,
don't evaluate to a value. <br/>
They do `side effects` to be useful. It could mean producing user-visible output or modifying some state in the interpreter that can be detecting later

## Statements

1. **Expression statement** : Let's you evalutate an expression where a statement is expected -- function calls

2. **Print statement** : Evaluates an expression and displays the result to the user

> A script is simply a list of statements
Grammar rules:

```
  program -> statement* EOF ;
  statement -> exprStmt | printStmt ;
  exprStmt -> expression ";" ;
  printStmt -> "print" expression ";" ;
```

Turn this grammar into something we can store in memory -- syntax trees.
